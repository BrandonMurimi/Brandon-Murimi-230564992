Hi there welcome to the world of coding.
**This project is going to display "Hello World"**
** I have used HTMl and with javascript functionality **
There's a button (<button>) with an onclick event that triggers the JavaScript function displayGreeting() when clicked.
What happens when you run this:
When the page loads, you'll see a heading, a description, and a button.
When you click the button, the JavaScript function will change the text below the button to display "Hello, World! You clicked the button."
